# Bash-Base-Converter
Base converter written in bash to help with my CS projects.

If you've never run a bash script before, run it like this:<br>
```
./converter.sh
```
<br>
<br>

I wrote the oldNotVeryGoodConverter.py first as a basis for the good bash converter. You can still use it but its not very useful as it is quite bloated and slow compared to the current bash version.
